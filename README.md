[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) /
[Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) IMAP, FTP, Rackspace Cloud Files listener.

Ryespy provides an executable for listening to
IMAP mailboxes,
FTP folders,
or Rackspace Cloud Files containers,
keeps track of what it's seen using [Redis](http://redis.io), and writes
Sidekiq- / Resque-compatible payloads.

Ryespy was inspired by [Redimap](https://github.com/tiredpixel/redimap).
Yes, it's sometimes possible to inspire oneself.
Ryespy with my little eye.

More sleep lost by [tiredpixel](http://www.tiredpixel.com).


## Installation

Install using:

    $ gem install ryespy

These externals are required:

- [Redis](http://redis.io)

Listener dependencies are required dynamically. That means that it may be necessary to manually install the indicated gems if you are using that listener. If you are not using that listener, there should be no need to install the dependencies.

- `--listener rax-cf` :
  
        $ gem install fog -v '~> 1.19'


## Usage

View the available options:

    $ ryespy --help

It is necessary to specify a listener (imap|ftp|rax-cf) and a notifier (sidekiq).

Check IMAP, queue new email UIDs, and quit (maybe for Cron):

    $ ryespy --listener imap --imap-host mail.example.com --imap-username a@example.com --imap-password helpimacarrot --notifier-sidekiq

Multiple mailboxes and SSL are also supported.

Check FTP, queue new file paths, and quit (maybe for Cron):

    $ ryespy --listener ftp --ftp-host ftp.example.com --ftp-username b@example.com --ftp-password helpimacucumber --notifier-sidekiq

Multiple directories and PASSIVE mode are also supported.

Check Rackspace Cloud Files, queue new file keys, and quit (maybe for Cron):

    $ ryespy --listener rax-cf --rax-cf-username vegetable --rax-cf-api-key helpimacelery --rax-cf-container vegetable-box

Multiple file key prefixes, authentication endpoints, and regions are also supported. Perhaps your account is in London? Fret not; use `--rax-cf-endpoint uk --rax-cf-region lon`.

The `--help` is most helpful.

Use `--eternal` to run eternally (no need for Cron).

## Growing Like Flowers

Dear Me, Here is a vague wishlist:

- Refactoring and testing
- Additional notifiers (e.g. URL ?)
- Additional listeners (e.g. AWS S3 ?)

Also take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tiredpixel/ryespy/issues).


## Contributions

Contributions are embraced with much love and affection!
Please fork the repository and wizard your magic, preferably with plenty of
fairy-dust sprinkled over the tests. ;)
Then send me a pull request. Simples!
If you'd like to discuss what you're doing or planning to do, or if you get
stuck on something, then just wave. :)

Do whatever makes you happy. We'll probably still like you. :)

Tests are written using [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest),
which is included by default in Ruby 1.9 onwards. To run all tests:
